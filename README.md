In my credit card fraud detection project, I addressed the challenge of imbalanced data by employing oversampling (SMOTE) and undersampling techniques. I utilized machine learning and deep learning models, including ANNs, to accurately identify fraud transactions. By evaluating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, I developed a robust system to enhance credit card security and minimize financial losses due to fraud.
